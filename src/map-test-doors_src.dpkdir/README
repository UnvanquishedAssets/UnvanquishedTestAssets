map-test-doors by cu-kai

This is a map for testing door entities, and so-called "button puzzles".

Each door / room is numbered as follows:

func_door:
1. automatic sliding door
2. button operated sliding door (including a floor-button which must be damaged to operate it)
3. trigger volume operated sliding door (simply enter the trigger or build something within it)

func_door_model:
4. TODO
8. TODO

func_door_rotating:
5. automatic rotating door
6. button operated rotating door
7. damage operated rotating door (shoot to open)

The door models are from the Blue Nebula game and the MD5mesh was modified to work with Daemon Engine.
